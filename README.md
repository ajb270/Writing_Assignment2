# Steps
--------------------------------------
### 1. Get a vase that will best fit the flowers.
 - The flowers should stick out several inches from the vase.
 - Stems should not be held tight by the opening of the vase.
### 2. Clean vase with soap and water.
 - Rinse well to prevent soapy water contanimating flower water
### 3. Cut rubber bands holding the cellophane to the flowers.
### 4. Unwrap the celophane from around the flowers.
 - Keep the flower food packet if it is in the wrapping.
### 5. Open the food packet.
### 6. Pour into empty vase.
### 7. Fill vase half way with warm water.
### 8. Swirl the vase to help dissolve the contents.
### 9. Diagonally cut 2 inches off each flower stem using scissors. 
 - If the flowers will be too short for the vase if 2 inches are cut off, cut a smaller portion off.
### 10. Put flowers into vase.
### 11. Place vase on a counter or table.
 Warning: Keep out of reach of pets.
